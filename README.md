## [Artifacts of Inception](https://www.anooshe.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/artifacts-of-inception/)
+ Vision and business case– High level goals and constraints
+ Use-Case model– Functional requirements (10% in details)
+ Supplementary specification– Key and mostly non-functional requirements with impact on the architecture
+ Glossary– Domain terminology and data dictionary
+ Risk List and Management Plan– Describe risks (business, technical, resource, schedule)
+ Prototypes and proof of concepts– Clarify vision, validate technical ideas
+ Iteration Plan– What to do in the first elaboration phase
+ Phase Plan and software development plan– Tools, people, education, and other resources
+ Development Case– Customization of UP steps and artifacts for the project 

## [FURPS+ Model](https://www.anooshe.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/?p=38)
### In UP, requirements are categorized according to the FURPS+ model:
1. Functional – features, capabilities, security.
2. Usability – human factors, help, documentation
3. Reliability – frequency of failure, recoverability, predictability
4. Performance – response times, throughput, accuracy, availability, resource usage
5. Supportability – adaptability, maintainability, internationalization, configurability
6. The “+” in FURPS+ indicates ancillary and sub-factors, such as:
7. Implementation – resource limitations, languages and tools, hardware,…
8. Interface – constraints imposed by interfacing with external systems.
9. Operations – system management in its operational setting
10. Packaging – for example, a physical boxLegal – licensing and so forth.

## Prototyping
### Consider a client requesting you to develop a system to maintain the sales leads for his company. This involves maintaining a client and potential client contact information. 
### Create an Inception Artifact document for this case, and a prototype (proof of concept) tackling one of the high risks use cases identified.
